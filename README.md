# Soccer Tracker

Track players time in and out of the game and their positions. Also, you can
take notes for games.

From a technological point of view this is an interesting project since it is an
offline-first web application which auto syncs with the back end (if signed in).
It uses the library [HTMF](https://github.com/jon49/htmf) which
makes development straightforward and fast but makes the application feel like
an SPA.
