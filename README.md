# Soccer Tracker

Track players time in and out of the game and their positions. Also, you can
take notes for games.

From a technological point of view this is an interesting project since it is an
offline-first web application which auto syncs with the back end (if signed in).
It uses the library [HTMZ](https://github.com/Kalabasa/htmz) which
makes development straight forward and fast but makes the application feel like
an SPA.
